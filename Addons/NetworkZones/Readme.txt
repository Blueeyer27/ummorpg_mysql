It works with uMMORPG ver 1.110 in addition with the NetworkZones_2018-03-16 addon provided by vis2k in the current latest version. 

How to use: 
Simple add this File NetworkZones_MySql.cs in to your Addons/NetworkZones folder.
Search for "public partial class Database" in the NetworkZones.cs delete this class or comment it out. 


The same as paulpach says applies here too

"This is provided as is, no warranty, I am not responsible if it offers your first born child in sacrifice to the devil.
I am simply offering it for free for anyone who might want it."
